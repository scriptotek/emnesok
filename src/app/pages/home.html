		Find books and other material about a specific topic in the collections of Norwegian academic libraries. Start by choosing a vocabulary from the list below. A vocabulary is a controlled set of topics. Searching all vocabularies at the same time isn't yet supported, but definitely something we would like to add support for in the future.
	</p>
		<!--You can also try to search in <a ui-sref="subject.vocab({vocab:'all'})">all of the vocabularies at the same time</a>,
		but this is currently not very user friendly as overlapping concepts from different vocabularies
		do not cluster, but rather shows up as duplicates.-->

		Once in, you can toggle between <em>broad</em> and <em>narrow</em> search. With <em>narrow</em> search, you will only get highly relevant results carefully indexed by librarians and subject specialists. By switching to <em>broad</em> search, you will get more results, but without the same level of precision.
