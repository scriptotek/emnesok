	<h1>Human Rights Terms</h1>

	<p translate>
		The Human Rights Terms vocabulary was initially developed in 1991 by the Human Rights Research and Education Centre of the University of Ottawa, Canada. In the late 1990s it was adopted by the Norwegian Centre for Human Rights (SMR), who has since adjusted and expanded the vocabulary in order to provide a great entry to the SMR library collections.
