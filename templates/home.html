	<h1 translate>University of Oslo Library Subject Search ß</h1>

	<p translate>
		Welcome to our subject search. Start by choosing a vocabulary from the list below.
		A vocabulary is a controlled set of subjects. Support for searching all vocabularies
		at the same time is not yet supported, but definitely something we would like to add in the future.
	</p>
		<!--You can also try to search in <a ui-sref="subject({vocab:'all'})">all of the vocabularies at the same time</a>,
		but this is currently not very user friendly as overlapping concepts from different vocabularies
		do not cluster, but rather shows up as duplicates.-->
	<p translate>
		Once in, you can toggle between <em>narrow</em> and <em>broad</em> search. With <em>narrow</em> search,
		you will only get highly relevant results carefully indexed by skilled librarians using the chosen vocabulary.
		<em>Broad</em> search will give you more results, matching subjects from other vocabularies or
		even keywords from a variety of sources, but sometimes at the expense of precision.
