<h1 translate>Hello there!</h1>

<p translate>
	Welcome to our subject heading search. Begin with choosing a subject heading vocabulary from the list below.
	A vocabulary is a controlled set of subject headings.
	You can also try to search in <a ui-sref="subject({vocab:'all'})">all of the vocabularies at the same time</a>,
	but this is currently not very user friendly as overlapping concepts from different vocabularies
	do not cluster, but rather shows up as duplicates.<br><br>

	If you use the filter 'Narrow' in the Catalog results, you will only find books that have been
	indexed with the chosen vocabulary, but you can broaden your search to include results from all the vocabularies -
	including keywords - by choosing the filter 'Broader'.
